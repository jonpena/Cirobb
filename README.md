# Cirobb V1.1.4

" Tested in Visual Studio 2012"

<b>Cirobb</b> is a <b>2D Rigid Body Physics Engine</b> inspired by <b>Box2D Lite</b> that was created with the purpose of helping people who are starting
in this wonderful world of physics for Videogames. The Engine uses the Erin Catto's Contact Persistence Algorithm
and it's implementation of the <b>PGS</b> (Projected Gauss Seidel) solver to solve the MLCP very well known as a <b>SI</b> (Sequential Impulse).<br>it also has a very simple <b>
2D Collision Detection to Calculate Contact Points, Normal Direction and Penetration</b>. <br>
The main Idea of this project is to explain in more detail how physics engines works,
I must clarify that not all physics engines use the same approach. This engine follows the Impulse Based Dynamics.



If you want to make more complex simulations with many Constraints and Shapes. 
I recommend you use better <b>Box2D</b> which in my opinion I think it's the best 2D open source physics engine that exists.

<h2> Future </h2>

Cirobb is a Physics Engine that is almost finished. Since the main idea is to create 
a simple introduction to 2D rigid body physics engines few modifications will be added to keep things Simple.

The Following Features will be added to the Cirobb Engine in the future:

* Direct Solver to improve the convergence of the Velocity Solver.

* The Distance Constraint. (Optional?)

* More internal documentation to improve understanding of the code.

* Modification of the .h and .cpp files to Improve understanding of the Code.

* Separate the graphics Library of the Physics Engine.
